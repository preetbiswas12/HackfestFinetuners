## 1. Executive Summary

## Executive Summary

The Consolidated Physical/Financial Positions and Transport Trade Capture project aims to enhance the existing Trading Data System (TDS) by integrating various functionalities into a unified platform. The primary objectives of this project are to develop a consolidated position screen with a customizable layout, improve valuation and P&L aggregation across all gas desks, and incorporate advanced features for handling spread options and exotic options. The system is expected to provide a more flexible and user-friendly interface, enabling traders to manage their positions more effectively.

Key stakeholders for this project include traders, project team members, and technical support staff. Traders are expected to play a crucial role in defining the requirements for the consolidated position screen and providing feedback on the system's functionality. The project team will be responsible for gathering requirements, designing the system, and implementing the necessary changes.

Major constraints and risks identified include potential discrepancies in the requirements gathered so far, technical limitations of the current TDS system, and the need for timely prioritization of out-of-scope requests. Additionally, the project assumes that traders will be available to participate in the design process and that technical issues related to the transportation model have been adequately addressed.

The project's success will be measured through various metrics, including the number of requirements consolidated, stakeholder agreement on the project plan, and user adoption rates of the new features.

### Contradictions / Gaps

* Requirements 1 and 2 under "Position Management" appear to be contradictory, as one suggests a single, fixed layout, while the other implies a highly customizable interface. Further clarification is needed to resolve this discrepancy. [de3e9278-51f1-4382-a6b0-6e6000f9d5a7, 0e3b473e-d00e-4065-ab76-cbbb8868dba1]
* Some requirements, such as "The system shall include the Gas Price book into TDS" lack specific details on how this should be implemented. Further elaboration is needed to make this a clear functional requirement. [0e3b473e-d00e-4065-ab76-cbbb8868dba1]
